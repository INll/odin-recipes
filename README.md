### First actual HTML project

I’ve coded in HTML and CSS before in CS50x, but that was for one of the assignments in the course. 

This will be a project on building a simple recipe site using nothing but vanilla HTML. This project demonstrates what I’ve acquired during the HTML Foundations module.
